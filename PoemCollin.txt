Saturday morning rain still doing this code thing
two more lines so Jacob can figure out this mess
and here is the third maybe it will work 
but it did not so now i have to write two more
i will be writing lines all afternoon
there are so many lines and so little time
lines on top of lines and even more little lines
Jacob is so demanding about his lines
he says this is exploration so I keep writing
Now we are at line ten and he says its complicated
It is still complicated
But complicated things take time and patience
Line after line after line after line
Its always one more line until the next line
The lines keep coming until its time to eat
