Collin is in a mood today
Collin is so nice. He helps me go through this
Collin is getting excited now haha
This is Jacob 4th merge to test the git commit --amend
I'm trying to use git commit --amend to test it again
This is so complicated but I like it
This is the 7th commit and I'm trying to test git rebase now
Collin doesn't understand that git is complicated
I'm so tired for this
I'm exhausted now
Really?
Ok
